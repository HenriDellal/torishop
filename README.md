# Torishop script

This is my first ever (if I didn't forget anything) piece of code. Written in 2013 and is a script for a fighting game Toribash.

The purpose of this script is to replace in-game shop UI with something more convenient. It was better than the default one at the time, but due to bugs it worked only with specific resolution (if I understand it correctly) (and sadly I didn't know about it before). If you are that curious, you can download the old Toribash version, change window resolution to 1000x700 and load the script.

Saving this for myself here.
